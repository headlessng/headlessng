# @headlessng/primitives

A set of completely unstyled, fully accessible Angular components for building design systems and web applications.

## Installation

To install the latest version of package, use the following command:

```sh
npm install @headlessui/primitives@latest
```

## Documentation

Each component in the package is built based on the [Secondary Entry Point](https://github.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/blob/main/docs/secondary-entrypoints.md). To use a specific component, use the following import pattern::

```typescript
import { } from '@headlessui/primitives/{COMPONENT_NAME}';
```

Each component works independently, so you can build your design system gradually. Below you will find links to documentation for each component:
